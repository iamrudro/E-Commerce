->Express: Express is a minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js that helps developers build server-side applications efficiently. It provides:
· Routing: For handling requests (GET, POST, etc.) and defining endpoints.
· Middleware: To process requests and responses (e.g., authentication,logging).
· Scalability: Lightweight and easily extendable.
It's widely used for creating APls and web applications due to its simplicity and
rich ecosystem of plugins.

->Dotenv: The dotenv package is a Node.js library that allows you to manage environment variables efficiently. It reads a .env file in your project and loads the variables into process.env, making them accessible in your application.
Key Features:
· Security: Keeps sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and secret tokens out of the source code.
· Ease of use: Simplifies configuration for different environments (development, testing, production).
· Lightweight: Adds minimal overhead to your project.

->Mongoose: Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It simplifies working with MongoDB by providing:
· Schema-based modeling: Define the structure of your documents in the
database.
· Data validation: Enforce rules for the data before saving.
· Query building: Easily interact with the database using methods instead of raw queries.

->validator : The validator package is a popular JavaScript library used for data validation and sanitization in Node.js. It provides a collection of robust, pre-built validation and sanitization functions for common use cases, such as validating email addresses, URLs, and much more.

->bcrypt: is a library in Node.js used for securely hashing and verifying passwords. It is widely used in authentication systems to protect user credentials. The hashing process ensures that even if a database is compromised, the plain-text passwords cannot easily be retrieved.

Password --> 123456789
Hashed Password --> $2b$10$e2F3G6x.jNJ75hq17v42POxX5e4uAa7jmsHQdkBvSYOhE3m9xF8m6

->JWT-JSON Web Token: It is used to securely transfer information between two parties (e.g., a client and a server) in a compact, verifiable format. Its primary purposes are authentication, authorization, and information exchange.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

->cookie-parser: The cookie-parser middleware is a Node.js package used with Express.js applications to parse cookies attached to incoming HTTP requests. It makes it easier to work with cookies by converting them into an easily accessible object (req.cookies) within the request object.
Client:Send a request to the server with cookies.
Server:Uses cookie-parser to parse the cookies.
--The client sends the cookies , the server is the one that needs cookie-parser to interpret and manage them.
